An Event Creation and Display App for all Student Clubs and Societies 

Problem Statement:

It has been observed that keeping track of various events being organised by the multitude of Clubs and Societies in Colleges and Universities can be quite a difficult task. It may result in the missing of important events and opportunities that might be highly beneficial to the students. Since a smartphone is a utility which is utilised by almost all the Students, a Mobile Application which can help them keep track of this can be very useful. 

Proposed Solution :

This project proposes an "Event Creation and Display" to keep track of all the events being organised by the Clubs and Societies of our Campus. Whenever a students logs into the App, they are directed to a Display Page where they can see a list of all the current events. They may also register for the events through the links provided in the App itself. There is also an Option for them to contact a particular Club/Society if they have an idea for an event relevant to them. The data of the registered students is stored in the Firebase. Currently, the Project caters to the need of our own Campus of BITD but we would like to extend its scope to other institutions to provide an "Event Management System" in future in collaboration.

Functionalities & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive User interface which helps the students to view the list of existing events, register for them or to suggest new events to the concerned Clubs and Societies. Following are a few of the Android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in the App :
Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of Google sign in Option to make it easier for the students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. 
Easy and swift Navigation: The Project uses Android Navigation library and its various components to switch between different screens.
RecyclerView : To present the list of different Events along with their images, Register Button and the capability to Like a post.


Application Link & Future Scope :

You can access the app at : https://github.com/Akshat0410/NewsSpace

Once the app is fully tested and functional, we plan to add some more functionalities like Comment and Share feature. We also aim to collaborate with other institutes to include their events so that students may have access to the Inter-College events from all over the country.
